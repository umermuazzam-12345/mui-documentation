# MUI - Overview

After installation, you can import any Material UI component and start playing around. For example, try changing the variant on the Button to outlined to see how the style changes:
Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. It's comprehensive and can be used in production out of the box.

## Introduction

Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.

It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box, and features a suite of customization options that make it easy to implement your own custom design system on top of our components.

Material UI v5 supports Material Design 2. Adoption of Material Design 3 is tentatively planned for Material UI v7—see the announcement blog post for more details. You can follow this GitHub issue for future updates.

# Advantages of Material UI

### Ship faster:

Over 2,500 open-source contributors have poured countless hours into these components. Focus on your core business logic instead of reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered.

### Beautiful by default:

We're meticulous about our implementation of Material Design, ensuring that every Material UI component meets the highest standards of form and function, but diverge from the official spec where necessary to provide multiple great options.

### Customizability:

The library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features. The templates in our store demonstrate how far you can go with customization.

### Cross-team collaboration:

Material UI's intuitive developer experience reduces the barrier to entry for back-end developers and less technical designers, empowering teams to collaborate more effectively. The design kits streamline your workflow and boost consistency between designers and developers.

### Trusted by thousands of organizations:

Material UI has the largest UI community in the React ecosystem. It's almost as old as React itself—its history stretches back to 2014—and we're in this for the long haul. You can count on the community's support for years to come (for example Stack Overflow).
